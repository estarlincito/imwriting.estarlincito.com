> How do people refer to that when things are going well in life?

</Introduction>

<Contents>

That moment when you feel that everything is going well in life, you’re happy, and you feel comfortable with what you have. If you only have plain rice, you enjoy it fully, but if it’s rice with chicken, you enjoy it even more. You feel good in the clothes you wear because you’re no longer dressing to impress the world; now you do it for yourself.

You have the freedom to do what you want, as you have freed yourself from the religious filters that once tormented you, telling you what was right and what was wrong. Before, you followed the opinions of others instead of your own. Living happily means living without filters, living freely. You’ve set aside your prejudices, those that prevented you from accepting others because they didn’t fit your religious ideals. Now you understand that each person has their own truth and that we should accept one another as we are, even if our ideals differ.

You know that not everyone will accept you, which is why you don’t seek external validation; you validate yourself. You are grateful for good friends, those who stand by you in good times and bad, like your best friend, your mother, who, even if you leave her on read, is driven by her love for you to reach out again, without resentment.

You no longer need, you now prefer. You don’t need an iPhone; you prefer it. You control your sexual desires, so you don’t need sex; you prefer it. You don’t need a house, someone to accompany you in life, cars, or other things; you simply prefer them. This keeps you grounded because if you don’t get them, you will still be happy anyway. Needing comes from dependence, while preferring means it doesn’t matter whether you achieve it or not.

When everything is going well in life, and you live it as a bold adventure—because life is precisely that, a bold adventure or nothing—with its challenges and obstacles, you are there to face them and move forward, trusting in that inner magic that helps you focus and reach your goals. In the end, you feel that satisfaction, that beautiful sensation that you’re doing things right.

You do the right thing because it makes you feel good and keeps your conscience clear. What’s the point of doing wrong for financial gain, only to be tormented or scared by what you did? No, the best thing is to have a peaceful mind, even if you have little financially, as that brings you mental peace. You may have little, but you enjoy it more than someone who has a lot but lives in torment. That well-being of knowing that people can trust someone like you is invaluable. It’s true that you need money, but that need doesn’t lead you to do wrong. This gives people the chance to trust your ethics, as you prefer to do what’s right over what’s wrong. In the end, that brings immense well-being. It’s also part of that true personal satisfaction.

Being a unique person, unafraid of what others say, having your own style, being genuine and true, telling the truth even to your best friends because you prefer the truth—even if it hurts—over a harmful lie, that vibe that keeps you well and brings joy to everyone you meet, that which lies deep in your soul, being a good person without fear of speaking up or making mistakes; because if you do, you know how to apologize. All of that motivates you to feel good, knowing you’re doing what’s right.

Moreover, isn’t time the true luxury? Doing with it whatever you please, having the freedom to live peacefully, making life your best friend and enjoying every second of it.

True fulfillment lies in embracing our authenticity, freeing ourselves from the filters imposed by external expectations, and finding happiness in life’s simple wonders. By living with integrity, facing challenges with courage, and prioritizing honesty and well-being over the pursuit of material wealth, we cultivate a meaningful and satisfying existence. Let’s inspire others to embrace their uniqueness, live passionately, and appreciate each moment as a bold and precious adventure.
