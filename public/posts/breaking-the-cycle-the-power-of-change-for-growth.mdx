_Repeating the same actions and expecting a different outcome is the recipe for stagnation. Growth begins the moment you dare to change your approach._

_You can't expect your life to change if you keep walking the same path. Progress only comes when you're willing to take a different route._

_Sticking to old habits will keep you exactly where you are. To see new results, you must embrace new ways of thinking and doing._
