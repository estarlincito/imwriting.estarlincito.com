_The satisfaction you feel when you do things for yourself is immense: working to earn your own money, then buying what you want._

_Cooking the food youâ€™re going to eat, cleaning the house, organizing everythingâ€”when you see the results, you feel that indescribable satisfaction._

_You feel that everything is going well in your life, even though there may be things youâ€™d prefer. But know that those things are not more important than the very act of living._

_So in the end, you learn to enjoy the things you have now, because if youâ€™re not happy with what you have, you wonâ€™t be happy with what you think you need. Thatâ€™s called personal satisfaction._ ðŸ§¸
