### Don’t Stop Being a Good Person

In the end, we are human beings with different ideas, so don’t let anger take over. Simply accept the other person as they are and continue being kind. Their ideals are different from yours, but that doesn’t mean that person should be your enemy. Always remember to maintain a line of respect; respect their ideals and don’t try to change them. Not everyone has to think the same way you do. Moreover, remember: _What others think of you is their reality, not yours_.

### Beware of the Majority Opinion

We often think almost everyone thinks alike. When you look at the origin of that thought, where it comes from, etc., you realize it’s the opinion of your community that has been instilled in you since childhood. As **Glennon Doyle Melton** said, from a young age, we are _domesticated_; we are taught universal truths, and sometimes we fail to realize that we simply take it for granted that the truth is the opinion of the majority; in other words, we don’t reason for ourselves; we just let ourselves be domesticated. So please be careful and try to have your own critical reasoning.

### Invalidations

When we begin to reason for ourselves, step outside the social box, and think differently, many people will want to invalidate you. They will make it clear that many people think differently than you do, that you are wrong, that maybe that way of thinking will lead you to madness. When that happens, you may feel confused, overwhelmed by fear and insecurity. Please be very careful. Don’t let anyone undermine your foundations. Of course, give yourself a moment to think about whether you really need to change your ideals, but only when you can think clearly. The moment you feel bad about what others say about you can push you to change, meaning you might simply change to fit the mold. Remember again: _What others think of you is their reality, not yours_. So don’t let the reality of others overshadow your reality. Each person has their own truth based on their life journey, upbringing, culture, and what they read...

### Being Right

Sometimes we argue just to be right. Then, we don’t leave room to reason and think about whether what the other person is saying makes any sense. If you see that you are in a discussion where the prize is to be right, it’s better to let that go. Keep in mind that each person has their own reality and, within their reality, their truth. So sometimes it’s better to back down. I’ve realized that when we try to be right, we make the other person feel bad, or we feel bad about what the other person tells us. I remember once trying to explain to someone why I don’t like college. I started by saying that people go to college to want to be someone, that they go just because society pushes them. Of course, this person felt bad because they were studying at university. The reality is that if I were in their shoes, I would feel bad too, and those are their ideals; that’s their truth, and I was contradicting their truth. So the best thing is to leave the person alone and let them continue on their path. In the end, it’s their life, not yours; these are their ideals.

> _&quot;If your plans are not liked, if your dreams don’t fit into someone else’s molds, do it: just go alone&quot;_ <br/> **-Valeria Sabater-**

Life is a unique journey, and each person is weaving their own narrative. It’s
crucial to remember that everyone carries their own truth. One's experiences,
shaped by their history, values, and beliefs, form the foundation of their
unique reality. Recognizing and respecting this diversity of truths not only
enriches our interactions but also allows us to appreciate the complexity and
richness of human existence. Instead of imposing our opinions, understanding
and respecting different perspectives helps us connect with others in this
incredible tapestry of life.
