A young man wanted to leave the Dominican Republic (DR) for the USA or Spain and started talking about his plans. Suddenly, his uncle told him that he was studying English because he wanted to travel too, as there weren’t many opportunities in the DR. The uncle began a speech, trying to convince the young man that he should also consider leaving the country. The young man agreed. The uncle mentioned that his son was working on getting a scholarship to study abroad, which made the young man very interested. Since they were family, the young man contacted his cousin to ask about the scholarship. However, the cousin told him that, for the moment, there were no spots available.

About 1-2 weeks later, the cousin informed the young man that spots had opened and that he needed to act quickly with the paperwork. The young man began gathering the necessary documents: grade records, high school certificates, his passport, and $320 in cash for the student visa application fee for the USA.

A week later, the cousin called him via WhatsApp and said it was time to take an English test to evaluate his level. Preparations started early because the trip from Cristo Rey to Hainamosa was long. The cousin told him to bring everything needed to begin the visa process. The young man got his documents and money ready. Together with his cousin, another cousin (cousin 2), a friend of his cousin, and the father of his cousin’s friend, they traveled to Hainamosa.

At the testing location, they were greeted by a woman. Later, a man arrived to conduct the tests. The man gave a motivational speech, emphasizing that this was a unique opportunity and that it should not be missed. He mentioned that he had a niece in the program who was leaving her university in the DR to take this opportunity to study in the United States. The man said he would handle the tests because the person in charge of the visa process hadn’t arrived yet, as she had just returned from the United States and was stuck in traffic on 27 de Febrero Avenue. He explained she likely wouldn’t arrive due to the rain and the traffic jams.

The young man and others took the test, as did other people who had traveled from various places. Afterward, the young man handed over his documents and $320, as the man claimed the coordinator had asked him to collect everything and bring it to her at the hotel where she was staying.

The next day, the man shared the test results. The young man scored low, as did several others. However, the man insisted that, since the trip was scheduled for the following month, they needed to take a second test to improve their results. A date and location near Ágora Mall were arranged.

On the set day, everyone arrived at the new location, which was provided by a woman who had taken the test 2-3 months earlier. According to her, she hadn’t passed it yet. Interestingly, the young man had heard that tests were previously conducted in Padre Las Casas, Azua. The woman, who had taken the test three times without passing, assured them that the process was legitimate. She claimed that some people had already received their visas but were delaying their trips to spend Christmas 2024 with their families in the DR. Her speech aimed to convince the group.

At the new location near Ágora Mall, they took the test again, with the same man overseeing it. He repeated the message that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The man also distanced himself from the process, saying he was only helping the coordinator, whom he claimed he had met once and found trustworthy enough to offer her his vehicle for transportation. He added that, since his nieces or cousins were involved, he had reasons to help. Still, he claimed not to know much about the coordinator.

After the test, one of his cousins (cousin 2, the one who went with him to Hainamosa) expressed doubts, saying there were rumors that the coordinator was a scammer. The young man also shared his concerns, noting that both the man and the woman who provided the location for the second test seemed suspicious, as their speeches sounded too persuasive.

The next day, on a Monday around 4 PM, cousin 1 called to inform him that the process turned out to be a scam. Rumors spread that the coordinator was on the run and being sought to face justice. Messages circulated claiming that the case was already in the hands of the FBI and that both the coordinator and the “college” in the USA were involved.

The young man remained calm at first but started worrying about his passport, fearing it could be misused or his identity could be stolen. He decided to report his passport as lost and began the process of applying for a new one.

He later spoke with his uncle and joked, “Uncle, the plan worked out; we’re leaving in January!” The uncle replied, “That’s great! If you have anything to leave behind, like a computer, leave it here.” The young man then clarified, “No, it’s a joke. The process was a scam. I thought your sons had told you.” The uncle admitted he didn’t know about it. The young man shared his observations and speculated that the examiners, the coordinator, and even some test-takers might have been working together. The uncle simply said he would call back later, as he seemed busy.

Cousin 1 stayed optimistic, claiming the scam rumors were false and were spread by people who, as the man mentioned during the second test, were sabotaging the process for personal gain. He believed the delays were caused by rivals who created fake visa profiles and wanted to discredit the program.

However, the young man chose to distance himself from the situation, fearing he might be seen as involved in the scam.

In summary, this experience showed how some individuals exploit people’s dreams of a better future. Despite appearing legitimate at first, inconsistencies, rumors, and persuasive tactics revealed the operation as a well-planned scam. The young man, realizing the risks, took action to protect himself, including reporting his passport and staying away from further involvement. This situation highlights the importance of being cautious, thoroughly investigating opportunities, and not blindly trusting offers, even when presented by family members.
