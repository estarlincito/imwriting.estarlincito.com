**Once upon a time**, in a vast and colorful digital kingdom, there was a young boy named Estarlincito. From a very young age, he felt a deep connection with computers and telephones. Although he didn't own a phone, his curiosity drove him to explore the technological world.

It all began when he was just seven years old. One day, he saw someone talking on the phone and wondered, "How does that work?" From that moment on, his mind was filled with questions and a desire to uncover the secrets hidden behind each device.

By the age of twelve, Estarlincito started to repair phones. He would take apart every gadget that came into his hands, marveling at how they worked inside. He also bought broken computers, even though he never managed to get them to turn on. However, that didnâ€™t discourage him; at school, he used the available computers to learn and practice. There, he discovered his passion for web development and began creating web pages with HTML, even from his phone.

He loved experimenting with operating systems and solving software-related problems. The satisfaction he felt when programming and creating new web pages was immense. Each time he succeeded in getting a page to work correctly, a smile would light up his face.

As time went on, Estarlincito became a skilled programmer. Open to technology, he exchanged his knowledge and skills for money, which allowed him to continue learning and growing in his passion. He understood that when one truly wants something, it can be achieved. His story became an example for everyone around him, showing that with effort and dedication, goals can be reached.

**And so**, Estarlincito, the brave programmer, continued his journey in the vast universe of technology, driven by his love for computing and the belief that dreams can come true.

**The End.**
