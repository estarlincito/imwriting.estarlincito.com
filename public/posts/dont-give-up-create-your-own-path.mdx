_I like it when things get tough; that’s when you realize you need to unleash your full potential, to push harder than before, and that if a door doesn’t open, you must keep knocking. If no one answers, you’ll know you need to create your own door._

_In those challenging moments, we often uncover hidden strengths and resources. It’s as if adversity sharpens our focus, urging us to innovate and adapt. Each hurdle presents a chance to redefine our limits, proving that resilience is the key to transformation._
