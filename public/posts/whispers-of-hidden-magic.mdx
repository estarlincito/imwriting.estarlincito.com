_There are magical people, I swear. I've seen them. They hide in the corners of the
planet, disguised as normal. Blending in is their specialty, trying to behave like
everyone else. That’s why it’s sometimes so hard to find them, but once you discover
them, there’s no turning back. You can’t shake their memory. Don’t tell anyone, but
they say their magic is so strong that if it touches you once, it captures you forever._
**-Anonymous-**

_These extraordinary souls leave an unforgettable mark, changing how you see the world. Their presence is rare but undeniable, and once you cross paths, you're never the same. Keep your heart open—magic is closer than you think._
