Additionally, critical thinking is not only crucial in the workplace and academia but also in daily life. For example, it can help us make more informed decisions about our health, finances, or even our interpersonal relationships.

One of the keys to developing critical thinking is learning to question information and not accepting it at face value. It is valuable to evaluate the source of information, consider different perspectives, and reflect on our own beliefs and biases.

It is also important to keep in mind that critical thinking is not a skill that is acquired overnight. It requires practice and constant dedication to develop and improve. We can start by questioning our own decisions.

Critical thinking is an essential skill in everyday, professional, and academic life. Fostering and developing it allows us to make more informed decisions and find innovative solutions to problems. Additionally, it helps us evaluate information objectively and reflectively, enabling us to live more consciously and satisfactorily.
