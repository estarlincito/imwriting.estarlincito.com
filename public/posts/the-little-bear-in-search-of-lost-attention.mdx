Once upon a time, in a village of bears, there was a normal village where both good and evil existed. The place was very beautiful, with some areas that were a bit ugly or, rather, poorly maintained. It turns out that Mama Bear and Papa Bear had a little bear cub. Mama Bear and Papa Bear had a very unstable life, as Papa Bear sometimes mistreated Mama Bear and was a bit unstable with the lady bears; that is, he couldn’t stick to just one lady bear, he had to have several.

The little bear never got to enjoy having a family where Mama and Papa were together with him. So, before he turned one year old, they left him with Grandma Bear and Grandpa Bear. The grandparents tried to care for the little bear as best as they could, but without the love of Mama Bear and Papa Bear, he was going to develop a poor way of acting that would cause him many difficulties in his adult life.

As he grew up, the little bear was promised by his grandparents to eat his food, such as: "Eat, little bear, because Mama Bear is coming tomorrow." The little bear ate with all the joy in the world because he thought Mama Bear would come to visit him the next day. Of course, this created disappointments for him, as he believed it was true that Mama Bear would come.

Not growing up with Mama Bear and Papa Bear, he developed bad attitudes and issues in his emotional relationships, such as insecurities, social fear, dependence, and other bad behaviors, with one of his greatest misfortunes being dependency.

Since he didn’t receive Mama’s attention when he was little, he sought that attention from every lady bear he saw. In other words, if he received a little attention from a lady bear, he felt attracted and wanted to achieve something romantic with her. If he walked down the street or anywhere and looked at a lady bear, and she looked back at him, he thought he should have something with her. He had a flirtatious and seductive gaze, as he used to look at the lady bears as if he wanted to devour them, speaking romantically. It was like a look that, when cast, sent a jolt to a lady bear, making her feel compelled to look at him again. If he started receiving some affectionate treatment from a lady bear, he thought that this treatment should last forever because when he saw that the lady bear was giving that affectionate treatment to another little bear, he felt as if the world were crashing down on him.

So, not receiving Mama Bear’s attention when he was little, he sought that attention at all costs from every lady bear he saw. It was as if he had a great hunger for lady bears. The little bear thought he wasn’t valuable, and that’s why he tended to be very romantic with the lady bears, just to get a bit of attention and feel something in life.

The little bear recognized that he had emotional problems and needed to manage them. He knew it wasn’t an easy path, but he kept the following phrase in mind: "Small steps lead to great results." So, little by little, he was determined to implement what he needed in his life to stop begging for attention; that was **self-love**.

The little bear realized that he lacked self-love to heal the attention he didn’t receive when he was little, which led him to develop poor attitudes in his adult life. Of course, the little bear wanted to make a change in his life, but without showing indifference to anyone. He wanted to treat everyone with the same respect, but he also wanted to prove to himself that no one needed anyone else to be happy and that we are all born whole; we don’t need a soulmate.

The little bear made the decision to prioritize the lady bears instead of feeling a need for them, as the term "needing" leads to dependency. He learned to be happy on his own. If someone was part of his life, they were welcome, but if not, that was fine too. Furthermore, he understood that simply being a little bear already made him important in life, realizing that the most valuable thing in life is being alive and enjoying every second. In this way, he concluded that he didn’t need to seek validation from others to feel fulfilled and significant in his own life.

Words from the little bear: Being a **bear** in life (being a man) means taking full responsibility for oneself, without depending on anyone or seeking external validation. It’s about bravely and resolutely embracing our own responsibilities, without blaming others for what happens to us or has happened in our lives. It is better to be responsible for our own destiny and forge our own path with strength and authenticity.
