<Introduction>

> Discover your worth beyond imposed appearances!

</Introduction>

<Contents>

Nowadays, media, especially television and social networks, play a significant role in shaping our perception of beauty and worth. We are constantly shown an unattainable standard of beauty: slim women with clear skin and specific facial features are presented as the ideal, while provocative clothing is used as bait to capture the audience's attention. This not only distracts from the real content but also perpetuates the belief that external appearance is the most important thing.

This distorted narrative undermines our self-esteem and confuses our perception of value. We are taught to believe that we are only important if we meet certain physical standards imposed by culture or our environment. We are conditioned to prioritize external appearance, neglecting personal growth and acceptance of ourselves as we are.

This influence extends to younger generations. Children, who seek role models, imitate adults who reinforce these superficial standards. If adults reflect low self-esteem and are governed by external approval, children learn that their worth also depends on others' perceptions.

We find ourselves in a cycle where we are influenced by what we see in the media. From imitating the clothing of well-known presenters to purchasing products simply because they are trendy on social media, we are conditioned to act automatically without reflecting on the impact on our self-esteem and self-image.

However, individual responsibility is crucial. We have the power to challenge these superficial standards. Recognizing our worth beyond external appearance is fundamental to maintaining healthy self-esteem. Looking inward, valuing our diversity, and acting from our internal principles and values—rather than seeking external validation—is essential for maintaining a positive self-image.

It’s important to discern that not everything from the outside is harmful. But we must critically evaluate how what we consume impacts our internal perception. Ultimately, we can choose to be authentic and true to ourselves instead of conforming to what the world expects of us.

This message arises from deep reflection after reading _Untamed_ by [**Glennon Doyle Melton**](https://momastery.com/blog/about-glennon/), which explores themes related to identity and the influence of society on self-perception.
