Once upon a time, there was a young man named Leo who lived in a small village surrounded by mountains. Since he was a child, Leo had felt an emptiness in his heart. It was as if, even when the sun shone brightly, part of his soul was always cloaked in shadow. He had grown up longing for the warmth of hugs and the sweetness of words that never came, especially from those he loved the most.

Leo worked in a flower field, tending to beautiful gardens full of vibrant colors and sweet fragrances. Yet, no matter how many flowers surrounded him, he always felt something was missing. One day, while planting new seeds, a mysterious old woman passed by. She stopped, observed his calloused hands and melancholy gaze, and said:

“Young Leo, the flowers you tend are beautiful, but I see there is a garden in your heart crying out for care.”

Leo looked at her curiously and replied,
“A garden in my heart? But there’s nothing there… just dry, cold soil.”

The old woman smiled and handed him a small golden seed.
“This is a special seed. It represents the love and affection you’ve always sought. But be careful—it will only grow if you water it with your own self-love, not with water from others.”

Intrigued, Leo accepted the seed. That night, as he lay down to rest, he placed it over his chest, right where he felt the emptiness. The next morning, upon waking, he felt a faint warmth in his heart.

Determined to make it grow, Leo began to care for the seed. But the process wasn’t easy. At first, he tried to find water from others: in the smile of a coworker, the approval of a friend, even the kindness of strangers. Yet every time he used this water, the seed didn’t respond.

Frustrated, Leo returned to the flower field, seeking answers. As he tended the flowers he had cared for for years, he realized something important:
“These flowers don’t depend on other flowers to grow. I’ve nurtured them myself with dedication and patience, giving them what they need. Why not do the same for my heart?”

So, he began a new ritual: every morning, he spoke kind words to himself in the mirror, even if he didn’t believe them at first. He wrote in a journal everything he liked about himself, even small things. And every night, before sleeping, he placed a hand over his chest, imagining his heart filled with warm light.

> _&quot;Leo learned that the most beautiful gardens are not the ones we seek in others, but the ones we nurture within ourselves&quot;_ <br/> **-Estarlincito-**

Over time, Leo noticed something magical: the seed began to sprout. From it grew a flower that filled his being with colors and fragrances he had never experienced before. The emptiness transformed into a vibrant garden, full of life.

The most surprising thing was that, as he walked through the village, people began to notice the change. His gaze, once filled with sadness, now shone with serenity. His coworkers sought him out, drawn to his newfound energy. Leo no longer felt the need to cling to anyone, because his own garden nourished and fulfilled him.

One day, he encountered the old woman again. She looked at him with a satisfied smile and said,
“Your garden is beautiful, Leo. Now that you know how to care for it, remember: others may visit, but you are the only gardener.”

From that day forward, Leo lived tending to his inner garden. He continued to enjoy the flowers in the field and the smiles of those around him, but he no longer felt the shadow of emptiness. He had learned that true love begins within oneself.

THE END
