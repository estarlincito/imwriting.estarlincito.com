_We are responsible for our own emotions, but we cannot control those of others. Our actions and words can influence the feelings of others, but it’s important to remember that each person is responsible for their own emotional well-being._ **-Estarlincito-**

_We don’t have to solve people’s lives or be rescuers for everyone who needs it. We can accompany, offer affection, but rescuing means carrying the burden for the other; bringing them to live in your home, feeding them, solving their life problems—it will never lead to something healthy. Each person needs space for their circumstances to help them grow. We can support, not solve._ **-Anamar Orihuela-**
