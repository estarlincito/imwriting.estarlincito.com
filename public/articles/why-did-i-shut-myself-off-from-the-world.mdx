It seems I shut myself off emotionally because, over time, I realized that many people only approached me for what I could offer them, not out of genuine interest in who I am or how I feel. I began to notice that relationships seemed superficial, which led me to build barriers to protect myself from feeling used. By avoiding opening up, I have isolated myself, creating a distance that has only deepened my loneliness and hunger for affection.

However, I know that the foundation of all this is self-love. If I don’t value myself enough, I will end up seeking recognition and affection from people who won’t give it to me genuinely. I need to start by strengthening my self-esteem, recognizing my own worth regardless of what I can offer others. From that inner security, I will be able to surround myself with people who truly enjoy my company for who I am, not for what I can do for them.

Self-love is the foundation that will allow me to choose better the people I relate to, seeking those who genuinely want to spend time with me without expectations or hidden agendas.

By distancing myself from those who only seek me when they need something and approaching those who value my presence as a whole, I can build more authentic and fulfilling relationships.
