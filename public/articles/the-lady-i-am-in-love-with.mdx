<Introduction>

> I am in love, almost obsessed; the truth is, I don't know how to explain it.

</Introduction>

It happens that I have seen a lady at my workplace. I greeted her as I usually greet everyone, but to my surprise, I felt that kindness, that genuine smile, and above all, that tenderness and humility—a unique lady who doesn’t like to draw attention.

She has a sweet and cheerful face, with little makeup, yet beautiful and one of a kind. She has chestnut hair, and that authentic smile that makes you fall at her feet just by looking at her.

As I always do when I'm in love, I tried to stand out a lot, and I probably made it very clear that I'm in love. I say this because it seems that the lady doesn't appreciate my way of flirting with her, possibly because she has a commitment, as I saw a ring on her right hand. Still, I kept flirting and occasionally caressing her face as if I wanted to touch her. However, I know that if she is committed, it's best to abandon that project because it's not good for a lady in a relationship to stray from her path and show that her current partner is not worth much and that her own words carry little weight. Additionally, knowing a bit about human behavior, when someone enters into a relationship like this, there are usually couple problems, and when there's hidden emotional pain, those relationships tend to end very quickly. Furthermore, if the lady leaves her partner to be with me, she might leave me for someone else in the future.

My problem now is that I have emotional pain because I feel that I can't move forward and form a relationship. I have this discomfort in my chest, and when I pass by her, I want to hold her hands or caress her face. If I see her talking to another man, I feel bad because, in my mind, that attention should be given to me and not to others. Yet, I'm fully aware that she needs her freedom and that a partner should be a choice and not a necessity.

The truth is, I don't know why I like that girl; it's something inexplicable.
Perhaps she has something captivating that makes me nervous when I'm around
her. I'm aware that all of this is just speculation, so I'd better try to find
out the truth about the situation.
