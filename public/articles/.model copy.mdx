Along the way of life, I got lost. It wasn’t sudden, nor was it dramatic—it happened little by little, through distractions, stumbles, and empty promises. One day, I woke up and realized I was on an unfamiliar path, with no map, no compass, and a bag full of doubts.

The first obstacle was money. I needed more, but every time I reached out, the world seemed to shut the door in my face. The jobs I found didn’t pay what my effort was worth, the opportunities seemed reserved for others, and the idea of a life where I could simply go out and get what I needed—like in an adventure—felt distant.

I grew frustrated. I cursed the system, luck, and even my own reflection. But in the midst of it all, something inside me awakened. I remembered that every hero in an adventure faces monsters before finding the treasure. And that’s when I understood: problems aren’t punishments—they’re challenges.

If the path was full of obstacles, then that meant I was in a story worth telling. A journey without struggles is a journey without purpose. So, I took hold of the wheel of my life and decided to push forward.

I didn’t find a magical solution right away. I stumbled many more times. But every time I fell, I got back up with more experience. I learned to seek opportunities outside of traditional paths, to use my skills in new ways, and to trust that every barrier I overcame made me stronger.

Over time, I realized that life is an adventure—just not like in games or stories. Here, there’s no clear guide, no predictable final boss. But that’s what makes it special. What truly matters is not just the destination, but how we choose to face the journey.

Along the way, I got lost, yes. But in losing myself, I found who I really am.
