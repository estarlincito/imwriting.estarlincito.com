> Stop depending on others for your happiness. Cultivate inner strength and create a fulfilling life on your own terms.

</Introduction>

To truly thrive, give yourself the love you've been seeking from others—that is the essence of self-love.

If you've ever felt abandoned, it's time to stop seeking affection outside yourself. The love and validation you need are already within you, waiting to be embraced.

Release the anxiety of begging for small scraps of affection. Don’t let people into your life who approach only for their own gain—unless they're paying for your services. Instead, surround yourself with those who genuinely care, add value, and offer something real and meaningful.
