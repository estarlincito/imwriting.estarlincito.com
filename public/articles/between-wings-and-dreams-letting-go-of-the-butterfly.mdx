One morning, sitting on the bed, I closed my eyes and began to visualize a beautiful landscape. There were gorgeous roses; I remember their colors—some red, others yellow and green. Additionally, there was a lovely garden. Everything was rewarding, as each inhalation and exhalation of air that passed through my nose made me feel alive, and I loved that sensation.

In that landscape, there were also butterflies, beautiful and brimming with joy. One of them caught my attention in a special way, and I couldn’t stop looking at her. My gaze was filled with desire for that beautiful butterfly. She noticed my attention but also my shyness, as I only observed her without approaching. It was then that she took the initiative and came close to me four times, though she neither greeted me nor responded; she simply allowed herself to be seen. Even if she entered somewhere, she would stay outside just so I could see her. This action left me reflecting; I understood that this butterfly wanted something with me, just as I wanted something with her.

Although there were many other butterflies, this particular one had me completely bewildered, to the point of idealizing her and pushing the others from my thoughts. Every action led me to think of her; everything beautiful I saw brought her to my mind.

On two occasions, I tried to make my intentions clear by giving her small gifts. Once, there was an attempt at conversation, but due to the weather, I had to run off without being able to talk to her.

I was determined to achieve something with that butterfly. I chased after her, trying to bring her closer to me, but it all seemed futile. Apparently, out of fear of society, she didn’t want anything to do with me. Still, I persisted in my attempts, even though my body seemed to act against my will.

Days passed, and I clung to the illusion of that butterfly. I remember a little bird named Now approached me and asked, “Why chase someone when what you really need is to have them by your side?” That question left me speechless and surprised. I realized its truth. I shouldn’t continue chasing that butterfly that didn’t want to be caught. Nor should I block her path. The best thing to do was to walk alongside her, allowing her freedom.

Goodbye, butterfly. Today, I choose to let you be free, just like me. Continue on your path. I won’t chase you or run after you. That would only damage my self-esteem. It doesn’t mean you aren’t special; rather, it means you are free. You have the right to choose who will fly by your side.

In the journey of life, I celebrate freedom and authentic love. Your freedom, butterfly, is sacred. You are unique, with the power to choose who flies alongside you on this journey.
