_If your plans donâ€™t fit into other people's molds, thatâ€™s okay; go alone.
If you canâ€™t find anyone to give you a push on your path, remember that you can continue alone.
Never lose hope in yourself; remember that if you can dream it, you can achieve it.
Donâ€™t let gray people cloud your judgment; you have yourself.
If you want something, go for it, period.
Remember that youâ€™re not alone; you have yourself, you just have to believe in yourself, as you are worth more than you imagine. Never forget it, believe in yourself; that is your magic!_

_And if you ever feel that the road is heavy, take a deep breath and look at how far youâ€™ve come. Every step, every small achievement counts, and they are all part of your journey. The path may be lonely, but itâ€™s in that solitude that you discover your true power. In the end, the destination is not just a place, but everything you learn and grow along the way. Donâ€™t be afraid to be different; your authenticity is what will make you shine. The world needs your unique light!_
