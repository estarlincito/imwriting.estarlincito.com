One day, sitting in the dining area of a place where I worked, my eyes fell upon a young woman with a beautiful style, a nice body, a lovely face, and somewhat simple clothing. The truth is that my eyes couldn't stop looking at her. Days passed, and my gaze continued to linger, to the point where I felt exposed to that young woman. I think my eyes were seducing her, as day by day, I kept running into her. Well, at least that's what I perceived.

I don't know how it happened, but I began imagining what my life would be like if that young woman decided to be my beloved. I pictured a perfect relationship where we would find ways to overcome both the good and bad times together. I envisioned her as a princess waking up in the morning, giving me a kiss and welcoming me to a new day. I imagined us cleaning the house together, washing the dishes together, watching shows, play-fighting on the couch, and showering together. In short, I started to imagine that young woman as the person I wanted by my side for the rest of my life and seeing her as the mother of my children. I wanted someone to share my life with, and above all, someone to raise our children with. I wouldn't want my children to grow up without their mother or father, as that often has a negative impact on children's lives, raising them with insecurities and emotional problems that they would carry into adulthood, growing up without the love of both parents.

All those illusions led me to act automatically and approach that young woman more. They pushed me to give her a little box of chocolates, but out of shyness, she rejected it and only accepted one, as I suggested she take just one. During our brief conversation, she gave me her Instagram, and I immediately liked a photo of hers that left me a bit bewildered. When I got home, my expectations for her were higher than the Eiffel Tower, so I sent her a message to say hello. Unfortunately, the message was sent but ended up in her requests folder, so she didn’t see it.

The next day, I saw her at work and approached to greet her. However, her greeting felt cold, with a hint of indifference. Honestly, I’m not sure if it was out of fear or if she simply wanted to keep me away from her life, although I think it was a bit of both. Despite that cold greeting, I held on to my illusion.

The following day, we crossed paths again, walking towards each other. She didn’t show any signs of wanting to greet me but mumbled a shy "hello." I replied with a "hello" as well, and we continued on our way. All of this motivated me to read some psychological articles about romantic relationships, and little by little, I began to let go of that illusion. Then I wondered why I felt so bad and realized it was due to her indifference, but mostly because I had created that situation myself by idealizing her and placing all my expectations on her as the woman I wanted in my life.

I learned that I shouldn't idealize someone or place all my expectations on a person without truly knowing them. Reality can be very different from my illusions, and it's important to keep my feet on the ground in personal relationships.
