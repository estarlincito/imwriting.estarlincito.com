Social taboos are unwritten rules or norms within a society that prohibit or discourage certain behaviors, ideas, or topics of discussion that are considered inappropriate, indecent, or taboo.

We often condemn certain things, such as questioning biblical teachings, because we've been taught that only satanic individuals typically question biblical matters. In other words, we're conditioned to believe that we can't question these sacred texts. We also tend to condemn certain people whose behaviors deviate from what we perceive as serious or proper.

For example, if someone has tattoos or wears earrings, we often label them as unserious. This is because we've been taught from a young age that anyone who wears earrings, smokes, or has tattoos is a criminal. Consequently, when we encounter someone with these habits or lifestyles, we automatically categorize them as delinquents. However, our playlists often feature artists with tattoos, earrings, and smoking habits. On Instagram, we follow people who do the same things. We listen to their music, watch their movies, and generally view them as serious individuals, despite having similar lifestyles to the "ordinary" people we condemn. To put it simply, we allow societal taboos to dictate our judgments, labeling people without truly understanding their motivations. We brand individuals as criminals based solely on appearance. We say that if an ordinary person exhibits certain traits, they must be a bad person, but if a famous person does the same thing, we idolize them.

> _&quot;The presence of earrings or tattoos in someone does not determine their goodness. Each individual is a unique canvas, full of stories and virtues to be discovered.&quot;_ <br/> **-Estarlincito-**

I remember a day when I went to do a computer job. Upon arriving, I noticed a certain indifference from the client. When I finished my work, I learned that he didn't like my new style, especially my two earrings. He thought those earrings implied that I led a careless life (possibly doing drugs, cheating on people, or engaging in illegal activities). The truth is, I felt bad, but I thanked him for his concern, as I understood that it was motivated by the social taboo that dictates that men should not wear earrings, as they are labeled as unserious. I know he meant well, as he didn't want to see me involved in bad things, due to the affection he felt for me.

The truth is, I got those earrings after watching the series [_**Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba**_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9335498/). The main character, [**Tanjiro Kamado**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9335498/characters/nm5137121?ref_=tt_cl_c_1), wears large, red and white earrings. I decided to get my ears pierced to replicate his earrings, but the ones available in the country were large and unattractive. I opted for the ones they put in when I got my ears pierced. When I put them on, I committed to moving forward. In other words, every time I see those earrings, I remind myself to fulfill my goals and objectives.

I'm sorry that society, due to taboos, labels people with certain things simply because of preference or because someone is an ordinary person. I believe that we can all be fashionable or give ourselves certain styles, as that doesn't mean we have to be bad people.

It's important to be authentic and resist social prejudices driven by taboos. Labels are unfair and acceptance varies according to social perception. It's better to understand individual motivations before judging others.

Follow your own choices, even when they go against social expectations. Stay true to yourself and persevere in pursuing your personal goals. Don't let taboos dictate how we live our lives. Recognize the value of diversity and individuality.
