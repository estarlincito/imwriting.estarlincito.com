Let your desire to live be the most important thing in life. Let your wish to cling to life be the most valuable thing for you. Let your desire to live be more crucial than any religious matter or belief. Don’t be led by fear, as it will cause you to make fearful decisions and live always scared.

Let your desire to live be the most relevant thing in the world, because remember that **life is what happens while you're busy making other plans**, while you worry about issues that only cause you to lose focus, keeping you stuck in a loop, going around in the same place. So please, stop being wrapped up in your worries and enjoy life. May you and life be like that glue that, once dried, is hard to peel off.

Hold on to life; **never forget that the main purpose of life is to live it**. You can have goals and purposes in life, but please, don’t let them consume you. Work toward them, but don’t drown in them. Live life, **enjoy every second**, your breath, the taste, the food, your relationships, but remember without fear. Be yourself and never allow your fears to make you pretend to be someone you’re not.

Commit to living each day fully and consciously, making the most of every opportunity and experience that life presents to you. Don’t postpone happiness or be led by fear; be brave and dare to live according to your true desires and passions. Make your desire to live the driving force that propels you to achieve your goals and find the purpose of your existence. **Remember that you only have one life**, so live it without regrets. Your life is a blank canvas, and each day is a unique brushstroke that contributes to the masterpiece that is your life. Paint with passion, love, and authenticity, and create a life that fills you with satisfaction and gratitude!
